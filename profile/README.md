At the moment, Kitstory is a hobby project created and maintained by [Kuro](https://github.com/kuroji-fusky) at [Fusky Labs](https://github.com/fusky-labs). It's a story-writing app with a notebook-like interface that can be parsed into screenplay script or a mock chat format from various social media sites. Licensed under GPL-3.0.

It's an on-and-off thing so expect some activity to flucuate randomly, and the entire project is still in the works because your mom okay?
